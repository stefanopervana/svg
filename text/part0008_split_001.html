<p class="author1">If you’ve <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="step animation" data-type="indexterm" id="sa3" class="calibre7"></a>ever seen a <em class="calibre2">Looney Tunes</em> or old Disney animation, you might have been impressed with the fluid movement, considering that every frame was hand-drawn. Such effects are possible on the web with <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SVG sprites" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633873552" class="calibre7"></a>SVG sprites, and we can stand on the shoulders of previous animators while employing new development techniques.</p>

<p class="author1">Of all web-based animation techniques, step animation most closely resembles these old hand-drawn <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cel animations" data-type="indexterm" id="ca3" class="calibre7"></a>cel animations. <em class="calibre2">Cel</em> is short for “celluloid,” a type of transparent material used by animators to draw on top of their previous drawings, thereby defining a sequence and creating the illusion of movement. This technique functioned a bit like a flip book. Each drawing was captured on film, frame by frame. There were usually several layers to these drawings to save time—you wouldn’t want to redraw the background again and again just to show the same scene.</p>

<p class="author1">In order to save steps in drawing, the background would be painted, and then the character or sometimes even just pieces of the character’s face, like the mouth or eyes—would be adjusted. See Figures <a href="part0008_split_001.html#fig3.1" class="calibre7">3-1</a> and <a href="part0008_split_002.html#fig3.2" class="calibre7">3-2</a> for an example of the layering.</p>
