<p class="author1"><a href="http://mojs.io/" class="calibre7">Mo.js</a> is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mo.js" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633119744" class="calibre7"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="external libraries" data-secondary="mo.js" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633118768" class="calibre7"></a>a library by an awesome fellow, Oleg Solomka, who goes by <a href="http://codepen.io/sol0mka/" class="calibre7">LegoMushroom</a>. He’s an extremely talented animator, and has already made some <a href="http://codepen.io/sol0mka/full/ogOYJj/" class="calibre7">awesome demos</a> for this library that have me really excited. The library is still in beta, but it’s getting very close to being released now. See <a data-type="xref" href="part0018_split_000.html#mo_js" class="calibre7">Chapter 13</a> for more details on how to use it.</p>

<p class="author1">Pros:</p>

<ul class="printings">
	<li class="calibre10">There are things like shapes, bursts, and swirls that are really easy to work with and spin things up for you—so you don’t need to be the world’s best or most creative illustrator to get something nice going.</li>
	<li class="calibre10">Mo.js offers some of the best and most beautiful tooling on the web, including players, timelines, and custom path creators. This in and of itself is one of the most compelling reasons to use it.</li>
	<li class="calibre10">There are a couple of different ways to animate—one is an object, one is plotting a change over the course of an ease—so you can decide which way you feel more comfortable.</li>
</ul>

<p class="author1">Cons:</p>

<ul class="printings">
	<li class="calibre10">It doesn’t yet offer the ability to use an SVG as a parent for the custom shapes (I believe LegoMushroom is working on this), so working with coordinate systems and scaling for responsive development is less intuitive and harder to make work on mobile. This is a fairly advanced technique, though, so you might not need it.</li>
	<li class="calibre10">It doesn’t correct cross-browser behavior like GreenSock does yet, which means you might need to write hacks, like you do with CSS. LegoMushroom has mentioned he’s also working on this.</li>
</ul>
