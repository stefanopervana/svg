<p class="author1">Canvas <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="canvas" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633028256" class="calibre7"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="React-specific workflows" data-secondary="canvas in React" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633027008" class="calibre7"></a>itself works beautifully in React. You can choose to bypass the DOM entirely and attach a single node, in which you can create all of your animations. It has the same benefits and limitations we discussed previously (see <a data-type="xref" href="part0012_split_004.html#canvas_section" class="calibre7">“Canvas”</a>). You can also break a canvas into React components, but the implementation details can get much more complicated due to the virtual DOM.</p>

<p class="author1">There are a couple of good libraries for working with canvas in React. React-Canvas was developed by the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Flipboard" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633024352" class="calibre7"></a>Flipboard team because they wanted 60 fps animation with the DOM. The repo hasn’t been updated in a while, though, and it really does focus on only UI elements, so any other kind of animation will take some work.</p>

<p class="author1"><a href="https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva" class="calibre7">React Konva</a> is an interesting, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="React Konva" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140658633023120" class="calibre7"></a>very declarative way of working with canvas and React. It creates beautiful shapes incredibly easily, but the animation performance is a little lacking. The developer acknowledges this right in the docs, so it’s possible that if you’re willing to submit a pull request (PR) you could improve it and help him work on it.</p>
